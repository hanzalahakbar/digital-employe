# LinkedIn Post — Agentic AI: The Agent Factory

> Ready to copy-paste into LinkedIn

---

The most valuable companies of 2030 won't sell software.

They'll manufacture AI employees.

Think about what's happening right now.

Plug in a Salesforce connector + Sales Skill → You have a RevOps agent working 24/7.

Plug in Xero + Finance Skill → You just hired a Financial Auditor that never sleeps.

Plug in Slack + Comms Skill → Your Communications Manager is live in minutes.

These aren't chatbots. These are Digital FTEs — Full-Time Equivalents that observe, decide, act, and self-correct without you micromanaging every step.

The companies that win the next decade won't build one agent.

They'll build Agent Factories 🏭 — systems that turn domain expertise into deployable digital employees at scale.

SaaS gave us tools. Agent Factories give us teammates.

That's not an upgrade. That's a completely different business model.


What's your take — are you still buying tools, or getting ready to manufacture your workforce?
